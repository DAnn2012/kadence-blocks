Custom Blocks for for Gutenberg to help extend the editing capablitlies.

== Description ==

This plugin adds custom blocks to extend Gutenberg's editing capabilities to better build custom layouts and make Gutenberg able to do more closely what popular page builders can do. With the [Kadence Row Layout Block](https://themes.kadencethemes.com/ascend-5/row-layout-block/) you can better control columns for different screen sizes plus it gives you full row editing tools like padding, backgrounds, overlays with gradients, vertical align and much more. 

= Custom Blocks Include =
* Row Layout - [demo](https://themes.kadencethemes.com/ascend-5/row-layout-block/)
* Advanced Button - [demo](https://themes.kadencethemes.com/ascend-5/advanced-button-block/)
* Icon - [demo](https://themes.kadencethemes.com/ascend-5/icon-block/)
* Spacer / Divider - [demo](https://themes.kadencethemes.com/ascend-5/spacer-divider-block/) 

= Key Block Features =
The Row Layout block can have 1-6 columns and any other blocks can be nested inside. So as a single column block it's a powerful wrapper because you can create very custom backgrounds and define padding and margin both for desktop and mobile layouts.

The Advanced Button block allows you to have up to 5 buttons side by side, Plus you can control each individually, both with static and hover styles and each button can have an added icon next to the text.

The Icon block allows you to add an SVG icon right into you page. There are over 1500 icons to choose from and with each you can control the size, color, background, border and add a link.

The Spacer / Divider block allows you to optionally show a divider inside an area with a drag-able height. The divider has style options allowing you to set the width, height, color, line style, and opacity.

= Editor Max Width =
One of the challenges with creating custom column and row layouts in Gutenberg is the width of the editor in your admin. By default Gutenberg uses a 650px max width for the content editor. While this can be great for writing text and in cases where you are writing posts that output to a page with a sidebar it's not an inappropriate size. But for content going into pages where you don’t have a sidebar it’s a poor representation of what you are actually going to get on the front end of your site. Not to mention it makes for a cramped space to work in if you are trying to manage a row with three columns.

In an effort to create an easier way to use Gutenberg in a more “page building experience” we created a simple way that allows you to change the default max width for pages and for posts as well as individually change that through a page by page setting.
